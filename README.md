# üß≠ Code Navigator AI Assistant

The **Code Navigator AI Assistant** is a comprehensive, AI-powered agent designed to tackle a significant real-world problem: the steep learning curve and barriers to entry for developers joining new or complex open-source projects. It acts as a personal guide, providing an **end-to-end workflow** for understanding unfamiliar codebases and making meaningful contributions to open-source projects.

This project was built for a hackathon with the core task of creating an AI-powered agent that solves a real-world problem by integrating with a third-party platform and using Descope for secure authentication.

## üéØ How It Solves a Real-World Problem

For many developers, especially those early in their careers, contributing to open-source can be intimidating. Large codebases are often overwhelming, and finding a suitable first issue can be a challenge. The Code Navigator AI Assistant directly addresses this by providing two core sets of features:

* **Offline Code-to-Codebase Guide**: This allows developers to analyze code locally and privately.
    * **Code Summarization**: Get quick, AI-generated summaries of code snippets.
    * **Visual Code Map**: Explore the repository's structure through an intuitive file explorer.
    * **Intelligent Q&A**: Ask natural language questions about the codebase and get relevant answers from an AI assistant.
* **Open-Source On-Ramp**: A guided platform for new developers to find and contribute to "good first issues" on GitHub.
    * **Intelligent Issue Finder**: Searches for relevant "good first issues" on GitHub based on the user's skills.
    * **AI-Powered Contribution Plan**: Generates a step-by-step plan to guide the user through fixing an issue.
    * **Contributor Dashboard**: Gamifies the contribution journey by tracking and displaying a user's progress on open-source projects.

## üèÜ Hackathon Compliance

### Core Task

The Code Navigator AI Assistant is an AI-powered agent that solves the real-world problem of onboarding developers to new codebases. It integrates with **GitHub**, a third-party platform, to perform its actions. The agent can:

* Search for issues on GitHub based on user-provided skills.
* Fetch issue details from GitHub.
* Analyze GitHub repositories.
* Generate a step-by-step plan to contribute to a GitHub issue.

### Descope Requirement

A key requirement of the hackathon was to use **Descope Outbound Apps** for secure authentication, and this project fully complies with that.

* **Secure Authentication**: The application uses Descope Outbound Apps to handle secure authentication with the GitHub API. This means there are **no hardcoded API tokens or custom OAuth logic**. Instead, a Descope Flow is used to securely manage and issue tokens for the agent.
* **Minimal User Effort**: The solution is designed to require minimal user effort after the initial setup. The user logs in with their GitHub account, and Descope handles the token management seamlessly in the background.

### Key Deliverables & Expectations

* **Real-World Problem**: The agent addresses the specific, real-world problem of making open-source contributions more accessible.
* **Descope Outbound Apps**: The project uses Descope Outbound Apps to authenticate securely with at least one external API.
* **No Hardcoded Credentials**: The application avoids hardcoded credentials and manual token exchange.
* **Working Solution**: The final product is a working solution that is stable, complete, and reliable.
* **Thoughtful Architecture**: The project has a thoughtful architecture with clearly defined frontend and backend components.
* **End-to-End Workflow**: The project provides a clear demonstration of the end-to-end workflow, highlighting the security and system interaction.
